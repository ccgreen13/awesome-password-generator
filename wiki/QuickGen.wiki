  # From now on you can generate passwords via taskbar button, even when app is closed!

To alter password length and other properties just open the application normally, go to *Single password generation* and modify whatever you want. Changes will be saved on exit.

== Security warning ==

Since *Copy to clipboard automatically* and *Clear clipboard on exit* options are ignored in the !QuickGen mode, the generated password will always be copied to the clipboard and stay there until something else replaces it. It's recommended to rewrite clipboard after using password (just copy something else in it).
