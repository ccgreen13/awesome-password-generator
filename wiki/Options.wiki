== Easy to type password ==
Strong password is usually long and contains symbols from different charsets: lowercase and uppercase letters, digits and special symbols. Such password is hard to type and even more hard to remember.

Solution is to generate password from lowercase letters (which are easiest to type â€“ you don't even need to press Shift) with 1-2 symbols from each of another charsets. Such password is easier to type and to remember.

As password consist of symbols from all selected charsets, strength is not reduced.

== Exclude confusing characters ==
Some symbols like 0 (zero) and O (letter) are very similar (difficult to distinguish) which cause difficulties when typing. This option makes it possible to exclude such symbols.

While hacker does not know you have generated password with this option, we can assume that the strength is not reduced.
