#summary Password strength

= Password strength =
Here`s how the program evaluates strength of generated passwords:

|| *Password strength* || *Crack time, days* ||
|| http://awesome-password-generator.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pics/weak.png || 0 – 7 ||
|| http://awesome-password-generator.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pics/normal.png || 7 – 60 ||
|| http://awesome-password-generator.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pics/good.png || 60 – 365 ||
|| http://awesome-password-generator.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pics/excellent.png || >365 ||

Crack speed: assuming 1.33 billion guesses per second (or passwords per second – pps). NVIDIA !GeForce GTX 295 can try up to 1.33 billion Vista NTLM passwords per second, so it's just a speed of a single home PC.

Professional cracking speed can be 100 billion pps and higher, but:
  * Different algorithms have different crack speeds. E.g. RAR-archive crack speed on a single PC is about 1-2 thousands pps;
  * Remote cracking of online accounts (e-mail, social networks, online games) is also about 1000 pps;
  * Previously mentioned professional cracking is expensive; hacker will not waste such resources and time without a good reason.

Anyway, using passwords with EXCELLENT strength is recommended.

== Strength meter ==
That thing under password called the Strength meter :)    Mouse over it and you will see a tooltip with combinations number, password length in bits and maximum crack time for the currently selected password options.
